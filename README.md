## Welcome to Infintiy Gym
---
[Infinity Gym](https://gwenjo.github.io/MS1-infinity-gym/) 


Infinity Gym is a fictional gym. I set this up gym for my MS1 project

The Infinity Gym site and his content has been created to increase the customer base.
Infinity Gym is a gym and fitness center, this gym is open for about two months. The gym is located in Almere Poort 
about 20 minutes from Amsterdam (The Netherlands). The gym has four rooms, two empty rooms for group lessons, 
a spinning room and an extensive fitness room. The guests can therefore enjoy a good workout and / or (group) lessons here.

## User Experience (UX)
---

<img src="assets/images/mockup.jpg">

Infinity Gym would like to increase its customer base through a free first month promotion.
User Story

User’s goal:
* As a user, I want to know what lessons there are available in the gym.
* As a user, I want to know the class timetable so that I can plan my workout routine around my favorite lesson.
* As a user, I want to view the gym’s contact information so that I can ask about the membership.
* As a user, I want to be able to locate the gym.

Site owner’s Goal:
* As the site owner, I want the user to have an easily accessible site.
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors of the class timetables.
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors the location of the gym.

## Wireframes   
---
With the user stories I used [Balsamiq] (https://balsamiq.com/) to create a nice and simple layout for the desktop and mobile screen.

The wireframes: 
    - Home/ about page
    - Lessons page
    - Timetable page
    - Locations page can be viewed [here](assets/documents/wireframes.pdf)

## Setup

When I started on this project I already knew what I wanted. A simple website where everything is clear.

Since I wanted to do everything perfectly in my head, I started over more than three times.
I've been working on multiple screens and got confused and forgot to save the pages in "git add". So, I couldn't save it after a while.

After talking to my mentor, she told me I only committed 11 times. This was not my intention, but my own mistake. 
I was able to restore my gitpod after saving everything, then clearing all .html pages, then committed + pushing everything, then creating new .html pages. 

That way I could record everything again. Therefore, there is probably not enough committed pages.

## Features
---
###### Navigationbar:
Each page has a navigation bar that contains all links to every page on the website. The - Lessons, - Timetable and - Location page. This is located at the top right of the page. Users can easily navigate through this. On the upper left side u will find the name of the gym

###### Header:
All pages contain the logo of the gym and a "Call us" button, which displays the gym's number when you click on it.

###### Footer:
Each page also has a footer with contact details, opening times, a download button where users can download and / or print the timetable, and three social media links that give all users access to our social media platforms on a separate page.

#### Existing Features

###### Home-Page:
The "about" is a brief introduction of the gym and where is located.
Below the about section there are two reviews that are displayed by guests (with their pictures) who are new to the gym and want to share their experiences with new users.

###### Lessons-Page:
On this page you will find information about the lessons within Infinity Gym. Under the information of the lessons there is a button that refers to the timetable.

###### Timetable-Page:
A simple and clear timetable has been created where the user can easily find his or her class. The timetable provides a weekly timetable with information about the times and locations where classes are conducted. It is also indicated how many people can participate in the lesson due to Covid-19.

###### Location-Page:
The location page is easy to find via the main navigation. On this page you will find the address and a small map of the location.

#### Features Left to Implement

For the future of the website it would be easy to create a contact form. Interested parties 
can then leave their e-mail address and the customer list can be expanded on this basis.

(Infinity Gym) and easily could crop my logo.
