## Welcome to Infintiy Gym
---
[Infinity Gym](https://gwenjo.github.io/MS1-infinity-gym/) 


*** Infinity Gym is a fictional gym. I set this up gym for my MS1 project *** 

The Infinity Gym site and his content has been created to increase the customer base.
Infinity Gym is a gym and fitness center, this gym is open for about two months. The gym is located in Almere Poort 
about 20 minutes from Amsterdam (The Netherlands). The gym has four rooms, two empty rooms for group lessons, 
a spinning room and an extensive fitness room. The guests can therefore enjoy a good workout and / or (group) lessons here.

## User Experience (UX)

Mockup


Infinity Gym would like to increase its customer base through a free first month promotion.

## Wireframes   
---

All wireframes can be viewed [here](assets/documents/wireframes.pdf)

## Setup

When I started on this project I already knew what I wanted. A simple website where everything is clear.

Since I wanted to do everything perfectly in my head, I started over more than three times.
I've been working on multiple screens and got confused and forgot to save the pages in "git add". So, I couldn't save it after a while.

After talking to my mentor, she told me I only committed 11 times. This was not my intention, but my own mistake. 
I was able to restore my gitpod after saving everything, then clearing all .html pages, then committed + pushing everything, then creating new .html pages. 

That way I could record everything again. Therefore, there is probably not enough committed pages.

## Features
---
<u>Navigation: </u>The navigation link styled simple and clear.

<u>Lessons:</u> On this page u find all the information of the lessons that will be given during the week.

<u>Timetable:</u> For the timetable I created a simple table using a timetable example  from [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrap.com)
this allows users to find the classes, times and locations of the rooms.

## Future features

#### Existing Features

On each page you will find a:

##### Navigationbar:

The main navigation contains all links to every page on the website. The - Lessons, - Timetable 
and - Location page. This is located at the top right of the page. Users can easily navigate through this.

##### Header:

• Infinity Gym Logo - This is shown in the center of the page. 

• Call us buttons - On every page there is an "Call Us" Button so that (new) customer's can find the number easily.

##### Footer:

## Technologies Used

* Github
* Gitpod

## Tools used
---

** [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) 
-   Before I started the website I used the Balsamiq software to set up my wireframe. <br>
During this process I modified the website several times and it doesn't look quite the same as the wireframes.

** [PicCollage](https://piccollage.com/)
-   I made the logo myself. For the Logo I have used an app on my Iphone. So that I could type the name 
(Infinity Gym) and easily could crop my logo.

** [Pexels](https://pexels.com/)
-   I've used photos from photographers who posted photos on pexels.

** [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/nl/create/color-wheel) 
-   For the font-color I used Adobe Color. [Click here](assets/documents/adobe-color.jpg)

** [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) + [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
-   The first schedule I made was from W3School. but I didn't like the outcome of the table. 
    Then I continued my search and found one on Bootstrap.
-   For the Quotes I used blockquotes from W3School.

** [Css Beautifier](https://www.freeformatter.com/css-beautifier.html)
-   I used this online tool to beautify/format my CSS code.

** [Auto-Prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io)
-   I used auto-prefixer to make sure my CSS works on all modern browsers.

For the button "Call us" I used the "model code" of css-tricks, I changed this to a "call us" 
pop-up. The only information you will find in this pop-up is the telephone number of Infinity Gym
